# User Documentation
### Multiple Choice
Simply open the app, and press the multiple choice button. You'll be presented with a random question and 4 possible answers. Tap the one you think is correct. If you get it right, you'll be served another random question, and you'll have a point added to your streak. If not, you'll get an alert and a second try at the same question, and your streak will be reset.
